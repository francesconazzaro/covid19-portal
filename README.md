# covid19-portal
This is a Streamlit app to monitor the COVID-19 situation in Italy.
It is developed with [Streamlit](https://www.streamlit.io/). I used Google App Engine to deploy the application on [Google Cloud](https://cloud.google.com/).

The app is [HERE](https://covid19-dashboard-it.appspot.com/).
